A
poor
woodcutter
and
his
wife
had
two
children
named
Hansel
and
Gretel.
Their
mother
died
when
they
were
young.
Hansel
and
Gretel
were
very
sad.
Soon
their
father
remarried
but
their
stepmother
was
very
cruel.
One
day,
she
took
the
children
deep
into
the
forest
and
left
them
there.
Clever
Hansel
had
some
breadcrumbs
in
his
pocket
and
had
dropped
them
on
the
way
so
that
they
could
find
their
way
back
home.
Alas!
The
birds
ate
all
the
crumbs
and
they
couldn’t
find
the
path
that
led
back
home.
Hansel
and
Gretel
went
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest.
They
were
hungry
and
tired.
Finally,
after
walking
for
a
long
time,
they
saw
a
cottage
made
of
chocolate,
candies,
and
cake.
“Look,
Hansel!
A
chocolate
brick!”
shouted
Gretel
in
delight
and
both
ate
it
hungrily.
Now,
a
wicked
witch
lived
there.
When
she
saw
Hansel
and
Gretel,
she
wanted
to
eat
them.
She
grabbed
the
chil­dren
and
locked
them
in
a
cage.
The
witch
decided
to
make
a
soup
out
of
Hansel
and
eat
him
first.
She
began
boiling
a
huge
pot
of
water
for
the
soup.
Just
then,
Gretel
crept
out
of
her
cage.
She
gave
the
wicked
witch
a
mighty
push
from
behind
and
the
witch
fell
into
the
boiling
water.
She
howled
in
pain
and
died
instantly.
Hansel
and
Gretel
found
treasure
lying
around
the
cottage.
They
carried
it
home
with
them.
Their
stepmother
had
died
and
their
father
wel­comed
them
back
with
tears
of
joy.
They
never
went
hungry
again!
