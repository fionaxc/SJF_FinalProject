# Typing Test

### Project Description
We are creating a typing helper application in the terminal. Each user enters their name and selects from a list of text files to use for their practice. If the user can’t decide on a file, they can choose the random file chooser, and a random file will be chosen. Once they begin typing, a timer will start and the user will begin typing based on the words displayed from their selected file. Afterwards, their total time and typing speed will be displayed. The user’s statistics will be added to a leadership board, with all previous results displayed as well.
