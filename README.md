# Typing Test
## Fiona Cai, Soojin Choi, Joyce Liao (Period 4)
### Project Description
We are creating a typing helper application in the terminal. Each user enters their name and selects from a list of text files to use for their practice. Once they begin typing, a timer will start and the user will begin typing based on the words displayed from their selected file. Afterwards, their total time and typing speed will be displayed. The userâ€™s statistics will be added to a leadership board, with all previous results displayed as well.
